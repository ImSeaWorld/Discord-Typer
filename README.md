# # Discord-Typer

Ever wanted to make someone believe you're responding to them while you steal their diamonds? 
Here's your chance.

Slap this johnny into the developer console and to initialize it's just `Typer.Start();` and let it go.

The original Discord-Typer I had everything working, but after cleaning it up changing the channel seems to be an issue.

# I am aware of this issue and will be trying to work on it.

Currently this is the first released revision. I will be adding more.
